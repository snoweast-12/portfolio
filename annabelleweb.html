  Blue Morpho butterfly
</p>
  <p>
1) These beautiful butterflies are one of the largest in the world, with a wingspan of up to 20 cm.
</p>
<p>
2) The top of their wings is bright blue and the bottom is dull brown.  This helps them to hide when they sitting down or confuse predators with the bright flashing when they are flying.
</p>
<p>
3) They drink the juices from rotting fruit by unrolling their long proboscis and sucking it up like a straw.
</P>
<p>
4) The entire life cycle of a blue morpho butterfly from egg to adult to death is just 115 days.
</p>
<p>
5) Blue morpho butterflies live in large groups and can be found in the rainforests of South America, central America and Mexico.

</p>
<p>
1) The blood-red glider, is a species of butterfly of the family Nymphalidae.
</p>
<p>
 2) It is found in Central Africa.
<p/>
<p>
3) Some authors believe the species should be split into separate species.
</p>
<p>
4) They base this on morphological characteristics (mainly in the females) and DNA research.
</p>
<p>
5)The new species would be specialised in one food plant.
</p>
<p>
6)Currently, the following subspecies are recognised:
